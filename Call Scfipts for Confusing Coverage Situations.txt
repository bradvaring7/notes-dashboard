  <article class="script-card">
    <h3>🛎️ When It’s Courtesy Only (Not Guaranteed)</h3>
    <p><strong>Script:</strong> “We absolutely help treat those pests when requested! They fall under our courtesy list, so while they’re not guaranteed, we use product that kills on contact during the visit.”</p>

    <h3>💡 When They’re Upset or Confused</h3>
